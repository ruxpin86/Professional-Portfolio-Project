# Professional-Portfolio-Project
Professional portfolio project that I can use for future job searches!

The purpose of this project was to get a grasp on how to develop and deploy our own interactive portfolio that hopefully can be built upon in the future past this course to achieve gainful employment in the tech field.

Iterations: This went through multiple changes of the course of the past few days in an attempt to continually hone and perfect the use of CSS to better style this page.

Usage: By using the nav bar, the user is able to see an 'About Me', future aspirational projects, and links to be able to contact the web page creator.
